# ANDROID APP FOR ZENSE RECRUITMENT 

 Developed By Archit Sangal 
  

# Idea 

  

It is a flight booking system which involves booking of new tickets, cancelling of existing tickets and retrieving back the booked tickets. It also has a well-guarded (or hidden section) of admin who can add and delete flights. It has a database which maintains the flights by its Unique Id number and date on which it has to departure. 

  

# Project Scope 

  

This app can be made available on various platforms for download. These types of apps make booking much simpler and less time consuming. It uses less Data (Internet Data) Resources that web booking. It is more secure as: - 

- App Security is managed indirectly by Android Security Systems. 

- Data Base Security is managed by Google's Firebase Firestore Security. 

  

# Technology Implemented 

 

The project is made using Android Libraries and Gradle and is scripted in Java. It uses the inbuilt functions of java 11 and Android Libraries like androidx and resource identifying mechanisms of android.widget. It also makes use of email packages of java. 

 

# Experience 

Making this project I understood a lot of new concept of java and managing the work in a self-made deadline. It also taught me to be patient in developing as in android studio the errors are not that well pointed out. If there is an error, we will know that error is there and what type of error is it but that will still be a suspense that at which line or statement it occurred and to debug a code of about 3600 lines, you really need to develop I skill which is to be patient.
